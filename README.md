# react-without-webpack
React + React Router without Webpack compilation

DEMO:
https://khanakia.github.io/react-without-webpack/

There are tools like Webpack or Babel that seem indispensable when we work as frontends. But, could we make an application without such tools? Even without package.json or bundles? And being able to continue using the React API? Then answer is yes you can do.

Just to give it a test i have created the demo so anybody can take it as reference.
